        <h2>12 Months Guarantee & Warranty Periods</h2>

        <p>All guarantee & warranty periods begin from the date of delivery. If you suspect that there may a fault with your bed, please consult the section “Caring for your Mattress”. If you still feel there may be a fault, then please contact the retailer where it was purchased in the first instance and, if necessary, they will arrange for a bed inspection.</p>

        <p>A one year guarantee against faulty materials or workmanship applies to all models in the Comfort Beds range – unless they have been sold as clearance items or, in the case of mattress or bed only sales, have been used with a non – approved base or mattress that is deemed unsuitable. Any bed or mattress deemed to be subject to faulty materials or workmanship during the first year will be repaired or replaced free of charge.</p>

        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
        <p>
            The guarantees and warranties shall not apply when:<br />
            The product has been soiled or stained in any way.<br />
            The product has been damaged accidentally after delivery.<br />
            The product has been jumped on or damaged by improper use.<br />
            The product has been used commercially or has been misused in any way.<br />
            The mattress has been bent or folded in such a way as to cause damage to spring sets.<br />
        </p>

        <h2>Additional Information:</h2>
            <p>All reasonable efforts will be made to match fabrics and colours where an item is repaired or replaced, however a match cannot be guaranteed.</p>

            <p>Where the repair or replacement of a bed is not possible we will offer you the opportunity to choose an alternative product. If you select a product which is more expensive than the nearest equivalent you will need to pay the difference.</p>

            <p>The guarantee is non-transferable and only applies to the original purchaser. Proof of purchase may be required.</p>

            <p>The guarantee only applies within our usual delivery areas within the mainland UK. </p>

            <p>Your Statutory Rights are not affected.</p>

            <p>Comfort Beds will always honour your statutory rights. </p>
